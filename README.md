# Overview of Be A Programmer Website

## Purpose
To provide a platform where experienced programmers can mentor novice and aspiring programmers

## How does it work?
Experienced programmers post mentorshops. Novice programmers apply to memberships. A mentorship officially begins when an experienced programmer approves a novice's mentorship application.

## Types of mentorships
There are currently four types of mentorships: Standard, Extended, Project Based, and Custom. For more Details, please click [here](https://github.com/Menternship/overview/blob/master/officialMentorships.md)
